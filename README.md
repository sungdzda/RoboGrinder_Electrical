# RoboGrinder Electrical
Welcome to the **RoboGrinder Electrical** GitHub general repository. We use a fairly unique but powerful set of hardware to empower our robots with high computational strength, flexibility, and tasking power. Here you can find most information you need to get started with coding these electronics.

The repository contains:
* Documentation for logistics and style
* Help documents, learning resources, manuals, technical data
* Sample projects and software frameworks
* Links to other projects and places
* ......

You may also use this repository to practice collaboration and to enhance your Git skills. Git is a powerful tool for software management and collaboration. Remember! You can always use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (the graphical application) if you don't know how to operate Git just yet.

Please always contact me with any questions that you may have. I hope you enjoy this journey and have fun.
